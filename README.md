This C++ code implements real time use case of Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path from source to every destination.There are 56 locations in DTU college. Considering each location an integer value starting from 0 is assigned,when the user enters the source location,Dijkstras algorithm is applied and least no of locations from the source to every other location is calculated and displayed.
COMPLEXITY: The time complexity of Dijkstras algorithm is O(V^2),where V is the number of vertices in the graph.The space complexity of Dijkstras algorithm is O(V)
